> When do the seasons start in Canada?

This repository contains the data—historical and future—on the 4 seasons of Canada, namely the exact time when each season begins. All dates are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

## Brief

There are four astronomical seasons on Earth, defined by the movement of the sun in the sky. For the northern hemisphere:

- Spring starts at the moment when the sun is directly over the equator, going from south to north, called the [vernal or northward equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox)
- Summer starts at the moment when the sun is farthest north, also called the [estival or summer solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice)
- Fall starts at the moment when the sun is directly over the equator, going from north to south, which is known as the [autumnal or southward equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox)
- Winter starts at the moment when the sun is farthest south, also known as the [hibernal or winter solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice)

### Disclaimer

This [data](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/certifications-evaluations-standards/canadas-official-time/3-when-do-seasons-start) is posted publicly on the [National Research Council Canada](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) website. Huge thanks to the folks at the NRC for tracking and making this data publicly available for all.

While the information is presented in a visually readable format (table) on their website, it is not so easy to parse by a computer. All I’ve done to “fix” that is to scrape the data and present it in an open (standard file and data interchange) format.
